> [!NOTE]
> ### Project status
> The project is in its early stages of development, that's why it is not yet published on NPM.
> Although I consider many components to be feature-complete, I'm planning on adding a lot of global features which will most certainly break most of the components.
>
> So, use this library at your own risk!

## About

### Why?

There are a few problems with the official [**Material Web**](https://material-web.dev) library:

1. Using Web Components in JSX isn't comfortable enough
    > In order to use them properly you'd have to create TypeScript definitions, and often wrapper components

2. Web Components register global tag names.
    > I'm paranoid about global naming conflicts

3. The library isn't verbose enough.
    > The thing I don't like the most is the `md` prefix.

4. It lacks more complex components
    > I'm talking about the [Carousel](https://m3.material.io/components/carousel/overview), [Search](https://m3.material.io/components/search/overview), [Date pickers](https://m3.material.io/components/date-pickers/overview), [Time pickers](https://m3.material.io/components/time-pickers/overview), as well as newly redesigned components: [Sliders](https://m3.material.io/components/sliders/overview) and [Progress indicators](https://m3.material.io/components/progress-indicators/overview), and many more.

5. Recently MWC has been [**put into maintenance mode**](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/discussions/5642).
    > This is a big ðŸš© *[red flag]* for anyone using MWC.

### Existing libraries

There are some really good attempts at implementing the new [**Material You**](https://m3.material.io) version of Material Design, but none are close to being complete:

- [<img src=".github/images/react.svg" height="12"> **Actify**](https://actifyjs.com)
  - most of the components aren't spec compliant (it's bigger of a deal than you think!)
- [<img src=".github/images/react.svg" height="12"> **Material Toys**](https://actifyjs.com):
  - a very good **Ripple** implementation, although usage of CSS filters raises some performance questions
  - certain components do not have animations ([Checkbox](https://www.material-toys.com/checkbox), [Radio Button](https://www.material-toys.com/radio-button))
  - some components aren't spec compliant ([Switch](https://www.material-toys.com/switch))

### Regarding library choices

> I have never used React since I started using Solid.

I chose SolidJS over React because the former is more performant, offers fine-grained reactivity, and has a better developer experience. SolidJS has amazing community-maintained tooling, such as [**Solid Primitives**](https://primitives.solidjs.community).

[**Vanilla Extract**](https://vanilla-extract.style) is used for styling because it brings awesome developer experience (although it has its own flaws). I'm planning to expand on styling and add support for custom *"style adapters"* in the distant future.


## Usage

### Installation

The library is not yet published to NPM. You have to add the dependencies from git directly.

#### Using Yarn

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@material-solid/components": "git@github.com:deminearchiver/material-solid.git#workspace=@material-solid/components",
    "@material-solid/vanilla-extract": "git@github.com:deminearchiver/material-solid.git#workspace=@material-solid/vanilla-extract",
  }
}
```
